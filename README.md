Major Project : Vehicle Tracking Management System : The entire world has now entered a computing era, particularly Cloud Computing, which has been connected with the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT system functions as a cloud-based universal global neural network that connects various things, objects, and sensors. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and wireless sensor network technologies are ready to accept new challenges. As a result, a large amount of data is being generated, acquired, and stored, and that data is being processed into beneficial actions in order to take control over our lives and make our lives far more comfortable and secure. Cloud computing technologies facilitate large data processing and enable quick decision-making using different machine learning techniques. It also addresses the plethora of challenges associated with processing and handling those high volumes of data, as well as storing it in cloud environments. Nowadays every organization demands to update their information in the cloud so that data can be fetched from anywhere. In this regard, in most countries internet access is readily available to people on their systems and their smartphones, so the information transmission can be much easier and more cost-effective through the internet. Biometrics cyber security scanners, traffic and parking management systems, driverless vehicles, and home automation are just a few of the smart applications that use cloud computing and IoT together. The authors of this paper have discussed how data production, data integrity, confidentiality, authentication, and verification have become more essential as cloud computing and IoT-based smart applications have grown latterly.
